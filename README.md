# Tubes-AI-2

## 1. Repository Overview
This repository contains the ID3, KNN, and Naive Bayes algorithms built from scratch using Python. These models are implemented as part of the second major assignment for IF3170. We used to train a fairly messy dataset and perform forecasting.

## 2. How to Run
Simply execute all the cells in the file IF3170 Artificial Intelligence _ Tugas Besar 2 Notebook Template.ipynb.

To load a model, you can use the following command as a reference. For example, to load the KNN model:

``` loaded_knn_model = KNNScratch.load_model("knn_model.pkl") ```

## 3. Team Task Distribution
- Panji Sri Kuncara Wisma (13522028): Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, KNN, Integration
- Zaki Yudhistira Candra (13522031): EDA, Testing,  Report, Submission, Assisting in Code Development
- Ahmad Hasan Albana (13522041): ID3, Testing, Assisting in Code Development
- Haikal Assyauqi (13522052): Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Naive Bayes

Because working with .ipynb files can be quite annoying and difficult to handle in parallel, we collaborated on many tasks together to make it more manageable.
